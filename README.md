# Context

---

The project is about explore time series data in several ways and build forecasts for the electricity consumption. 

# Content

---

The data is extracted from Open Power System Data ([OPSD](https://open-power-system-data.org/)) for Germany. 
The data set includes daily electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production between 2006 and 2017. 

- Date — The date (yyyy-mm-dd format)
- Consumption — Electricity consumption in GWh
- Wind — Wind power production in GWh
- Solar — Solar power production in GWh
- Wind+Solar — Sum of wind and solar power production in GWh
